    <p class= "problemmessage">"168 million children in the world are forced to work.
Because the fashion industry requires low-skilled labour, child labour is particularly common in this industry.
In South India, for example, 250,000 girls work under the Sumangali scheme, a practice which involves sending young girls from poor families to work in a textile factory for three or five years in exchange for a basic wage and an lump sum payment at the end to pay for their dowry. Girls are overworked and live in appalling conditions that can be classified as modern slavery."
